        <p>A project placed on the back burner during college, this is a java application that uses a MySQL database to track to do items.
             One cool feature that I did manage to finish is the SQL processor, which will create the SQL database if not already installed.
              This feature was also inteded to be used for updates if I ever felt the need to modify the database.</p>
