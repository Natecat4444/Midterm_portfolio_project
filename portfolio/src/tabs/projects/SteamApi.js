        <p>A group java project done in college, this project was extensively planned before execution, with all documentation being availible in the readme.
            This application calls a steam api to retieve news articles published by game devlopers and display them in a javafx front end. The program also uses a 
            SQL database to allow the user/users to store their favorites.
